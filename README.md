# InfiniteScroll

This is a small project to test out Angular's virtual scrolling module.  
This demo allows someone to search any accounts' historic transactions on the banano blockchain and scroll through with ease.  Pagination is cool but virtual scrolling is cooler; once a user stops scrolling for a split second, the next page of transactions is fetched via an api. 

Check out the live demo [here](https://infinite-ban-scroll.web.app/); provided below are sample addresses with large transaction history:

- ban_3fo1d1ng6mfqumfoojqby13nahaugqbe5n6n3trof4q8kg5amo9mribg4muo
- ban_1faucetjuiyuwnz94j4c7s393r95sk5ac7p5usthmxct816osgqh3qd1caet
- ban_1monkeyt1x77a1rp9bwtthajb8odapbmnzpyt8357ac8a1bcron34i3r9y66
